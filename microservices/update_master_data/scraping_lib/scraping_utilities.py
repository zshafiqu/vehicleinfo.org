    PREFACE:
        - This file contains all the helper methods for scraping images and trim data from KBB.
        - The main objective of the methods here are to take in a BeautifulSoup object, and search
        through it using things like CSS classes and HTML tags.
        - The data is then organized into dictionaries and returned

    METHOD SIGNATURES:
        - convert_soup_to_text_list(soup)
        - mappify_headings_and_attributes_from_list(headings, attributes)
        - parse_soup_to_styles_dictionary(soup)
        - parse_soup_for_img_src(soup)

# This function takes a soup object, and converts it into a list based on all the inner texts from the HTML
def convert_soup_to_text_list(soup):
    items = []
    for item in soup:
        temp = item.text
        items.append(temp)
    return items
# ----------------------
# This method takes in a list of headings and attributes, and parses them into a dictionary where attributes are split by trim
def mappify_headings_and_attributes_from_list(headings, attributes):
    # We have a list of headings (the trims)
    # and list of attributes (all attributes for all trims, we need to slice this properly)
    '''
    An example of headings:
        ['Dealer Home Service', 'Base Style', 'TTS', 'RS']
        len() = 4

    An example of attributes:
        ['Combined Fuel Economy', '26 MPG', 'Seating', 'Seats 4', 'Horsepower', '228 @ 4500 RPM HP', 'Engine', '4-Cyl, Turbo, 2.0 Liter', 'Combined Fuel Economy', '25 MPG', 'Seating', 'Seats 4', 'Horsepower', '288 @ 5400 RPM HP', 'Engine', '4-Cyl, Turbo, 2.0 Liter', 'Combined Fuel Economy', '23 MPG', 'Seating', 'Seats 4', 'Horsepower', '394 hp HP', 'Engine', '5-Cyl, Turbo, 2.5 Liter']
        len() = 24

    See pseudocode below;
        for heading in headings:
            for attribute in attributes:
                go until you've finished this trim's attributes

        dictionary : {
            trim : { attributes },
            trim : { attributes },
            etc.
        }
