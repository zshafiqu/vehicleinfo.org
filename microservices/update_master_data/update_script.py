    PREFACE:
        - In our web application, we use an external source to get the makes and models of vehicles manufactured in the US
        - This data source simply contains year, make, model for us to mine information from later
        - We need to be able to seamlessly add new vehicles to our 'master_data' from the external source,
        while maintaining the information we already have. This script is the entry point to accomplish that task
        - See source here : https://github.com/abhionlyone/us-car-models-data

    USAGE:
        - To do this properly, download the updated CSVs from the above link and put them in a folder called 'external_master'
        - After that, run this script, and it'll prompt you for the range you'd like to update
        - Specify your range, and the script will go through a set of sequential steps to update everything
        - All the updated files will be in a new folder called 'new_master_data'

    ADDING A NEW YEAR?
        - If adding a whole new year to the data set (a year that doesn't already exist) :
        - Create an empty CSV with that year in the old master directory
        - The script will do its comparison, and none of the lines will be the same, so it'll just merge EVERYTHING into the new one.
        - OR you could just manually add the new year's CSV file to the 'add_new_styles'
